# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

This project showcases a responsive design based on changes in weather from the viewer's location. This includes the ability to swap between F and C degrees and dynamic updates to a list of items called from an API based on temperature. The site connects multiple .jsx files through export/import statements and takes advantage of React Router to link all files and create paths to additional pages such as a user's Profile page.
